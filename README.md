### Project Title
BikeShare python file

### Description
In this project, Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

    The source code takes in raw input from the user to create an interactive experience.
    According to the input the code will import the data and will provide information by computing descriptive statistics.

        most common start station
        most common end station
        most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

    Trip duration:
        total travel time
        average travel time

    User info:
        counts of each user type
        counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
